# 📘 C++ Learning Journey

Welcome to my C++ Learning Repository! 🚀  
This repo contains my personal C++ practice files as I work through tutorials, concepts, and exercises. Files are named sequentially (`Tut1.cpp`, `Tut2.cpp`, etc.) to track progress and topics.

## 📂 Structure


All learning files are named in the format:


Example:
- `Tut1.cpp` 
- `Tut2.cpp` 
- `Tut3.cpp` 
- `Tut4.cpp` 
- `Tut5.cpp` 

> As I progress, I may add folders or rename files for better organization (e.g., grouping OOP, STL, or projects separately).

## 🔄 Updates

This repository is updated regularly as I learn and explore more of C++. Each tutorial builds on the previous ones or introduces a new concept.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Compiler:** `g++`
- **Editor/IDE:** Cursor ai / Code::Blocks
- **OS:** Windows / Linux

## 📚 Resources I'm Following

- [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com)
- *C++ Primer* (Book)
- YouTube Channels: The Cherno, freeCodeCamp, CodeWithHarry
- Online judges for practice: LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank

## 🎯 Goals

- Master core C++ syntax and semantics
- Develop object-oriented thinking
- Practice algorithms and data structures
- Understand and use the STL
- Solve problems and build mini-projects
